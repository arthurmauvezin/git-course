### So, what is DevOps

* It is cross-team mindset like agility.
* You must ask yourself how to get a better deliverable from input team (ex: product manager)
* And how to produce a better deliverable for output team (ex: Ops team)
* Always think automation and continous improvement.
* Talk, and put yourself into others place
* Develop to the target (Dev == QA == Prod)
* Shorten Time To Market (TTM)

### How to start

* Not an easy task as we cannot force mindset.
* DevOps practices can be initiated from teams.
* Start from simple, then add paradigms step by step:
  * Continuous Integration
  * Continuous Delivery
  * Continuous Deployement
  * Continuous Operations
